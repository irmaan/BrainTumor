## Brain Tumor Detection using CNN
- A brain tumor, also known as an intracranial tumor, is an abnormal mass of tissue characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. This project uses deep learning, specifically a CNN model, to detect brain tumors. This approach is promising as deep learning has already been successful in various image classification tasks. By utilizing pretrained models or modifying existing ones, we can achieve accurate results in less time and minimize human error. The project involves preprocessing the data, training the model, and then using the saved model to classify and predict new images.
